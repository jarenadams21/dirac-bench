Dimensionality: Consider extending the simulation to 3D to accurately capture spin and electromagnetic interactions.

Numerical Methods:

Implement unconditionally stable time-stepping methods, such as the Crank-Nicolson scheme.
Ensure that the numerical scheme preserves unitarity to maintain the physicality of the wavefunction evolution.
Boundary Conditions:

Apply absorbing boundary conditions or sufficiently large domains to minimize reflections.
Gravitational Potential:

Re-evaluate the inclusion of gravity. If necessary, use a potential appropriate for the dimensionality and scale of the simulation.
Machine Learning Integration:

Avoid using machine learning outputs to modify fundamental physical parameters unless there is a clear physical basis and empirical data supporting it.
If machine learning is to be used, consider training the model on real physical data and use it to analyze results rather than alter the simulation parameters.
Validation:

Validate the simulation against known analytical solutions or experimental results to assess its accuracy.
