1. {N , γ, l, l(2), Y}, where N is a smooth manifold, {γ, Y} are symmetric (0, 2)- tensor fields, l is a covector field, and l(2) is a scalar field satisfying a certain restriction

2. When the data is embedded in a spacetime (M, g) with embedding φ and a choice of rigging2 ζ,
  the full metric g along φ(N) can be reconstructed from {γ,l,l(2)}, and {l, l(2)} coincide with the pull-back of
    the one-form g(ζ, ·) --> and the norm on rigging of course


### Notes of Improvement
* Absorbing Boundaries: Implementing absorbing or open boundary conditions can mitigate reflections and better simulate an infinite domain.

* Redfine equations into 5D with proper Gamma Pauli Matrices

* Invesitgate current main function before refactor
